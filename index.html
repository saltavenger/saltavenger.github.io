          <p>Dear Mr. Jeffress:</p>
          <p>This letter is in response to your May 12, 1999 letter (link) concerning the applicability of section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) to your facility.</p>
          <p>According to your letter Fairbanks Gold Mining, Inc. (FGMI) operates a large open pit and milling operation north of Fairbanks, Alaska. You state that the gold operation mined approximately 33.3 million tons of ore and milled 13.7 million tons of ore during 1998. Approximately 7.4 million tons of waste rock made up the 33.3 million tons of ore mined. The waste rock was moved to rock dumps. You further provide in your letter that based on the tonnage mined and milled, you believe that even at the average crustal abundance for TRI metals contained in the ore and waste, activity thresholds were exceeded. Based on this background information you are asking for guidance on the following questions:</p>
          <p>First, once a reporting threshold has been exceeded for a toxic chemical, is it necessary to determine for that chemical coincidental manufacturing occurring through the beneficiation process? For facilities that meet the SIC code and employee threshold reporting criteria, once an activity threshold (i.e., manufacturing, processing, or otherwise use) is exceeded for a toxic chemical, the facility must comply with the reporting requirements of EPCRA section 313. Accordingly, if the facility knows that it has already exceeded an activity threshold for a particular chemical or chemical category, then the facility does not need to consider any coincidental manufacturing of that chemical or chemical category for the purpose of determining whether a report needs to be filed for that chemical or chemical category. However, consideration of the coincidental manufacturing taking place during the beneficiation process will be needed to properly account for all releases and other waste management calculations associated with any toxic chemicals in which an activity threshold has been exceeded. As provided in 40 CFR section 372.25(c)(), once an activity threshold is exceeded and a report needs to be filed, the facility must consider toward release and other waste management calculations all non-exempt activities and not just those activities which contributed to the activity threshold that was exceeded. For example, all releases and other waste management activities associated with the manufacturing and processing of a toxic chemical must be included in the report for a toxic chemical even if the otherwise use threshold is the only activity threshold that is exceeded for that chemical. In addition, facilities should check all the appropriate boxes in Part II, Section 3 of the Form R.</p> 
          <p>Second, you ask for clarification regarding the guidance provided in the March 19, 1999 letter to the Alta Gold Mining Company. That letter provides that if any of the arsenic or other toxic chemicals is incorporated into the dore, then the entire quantity of the arsenic and/or other toxic chemicals in the leach pad, and not just the quantity in the dore, is considered “processed” and should be applied to the appropriate processing threshold determinations. That letter also provides, as you point out, that the de minimis exemption may be considered for toxic chemicals that are processed.</p>
          <p>Third, you ask, since EPCRA section 313 metals are in the dore and therefore, are clearly within the definition of processing, does the mining industry need to consider the coincidental manufacturing of toxic chemicals remaining in the leach circuit? Yes. As stated in the answer to your first question, coincidental manuf</p>

          <p>Dear Mr. Spear:</p>
          <p>This is in response to your letter dated December 22, 1997 (link), in which you requested guidance on whether or not the article exemption applies to lead in zinc slabs used in the hot dip galvanizing process at Trinity Industries, Inc. For a toxic chemical in an item, in your case the zinc slab containing lead, to be exempt as part of the article, the item must meet all the following criteria in the Section 313 article definition; that is, it must be a manufactured item that is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture, that has end use functions dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use, and that does not release a toxic chemical under normal circumstances of processing or otherwise use of the item at the facility.</p>
          <p>EPA guidance also states that if. as a result of processing or otherwise use, an item retains its initial thickness or diameter, in whole or in part, it meets the first part of the definition. If the item_single_quote_s basic dimensional characteristics are totally altered during processing or otherwise use, the item does not meet the first part of the definition.</p>
          <p>In your letter, you state that zinc slabs which contain the lead, are placed in a galvanizing bath of molten zinc and melted. In the bath. a liquid layer of almost pure lead is formed at the bottom. From the description you processed, we believe the lead does not qualify for the article exemption. If the zinc slabs containing the lead are melted in the galvanizing bath, the dimensional characteristics of the slabs are retained neither in whole nor in part. Also, if the dimensions are totally altered in the process, the end use functions are not dependent upon the shape of design during end use. In order for the article exemption to be taken. the item must meet all three criteria of the article definition.</p>
          <p>I hope this guidance is sufficient for your needs. If you have further questions, please contact me at (202) 260-9592, or Maria Spina of my staff at (202) 260-7258.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
